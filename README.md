To-Do List Application
A feature-rich, responsive, single-page To-Do List application built with modern vanilla JavaScript. This project, part of The Odin Project curriculum, demonstrates a solid understanding of object-oriented programming, modular architecture, and browser data persistence without relying on any front-end frameworks.

Tech Stack & Core Concepts
This project was built from the ground up to showcase a strong foundation in core web technologies and software architecture.
Languages: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
Build Tool: Webpack
Key JavaScript Concepts:
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Utilizes Classes (Project) and Factory Functions (createToDoItems) to model the application's data.
ES6 Modules: The codebase is organized into logical, reusable modules (ui.js, storage.js, etc.) using import/export syntax.
DOM Manipulation: All UI components are dynamically rendered and updated using the DOM API.
State Management: A simple but effective state management system tracks the "active project" and ensures the UI always reflects the current data.
Data Persistence: Leverages the browser's localStorage API to save and load all user data.
